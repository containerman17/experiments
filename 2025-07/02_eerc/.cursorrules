# Project Rules

## Development Environment
- Don't run the development server (`npm run dev`) - the user keeps it running in the background
- This is a demo app, not a production app - keep implementations simple and straightforward

## Tech Stack
- React with TypeScript
- Vite as build tool
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- viem for blockchain interactions
- zustand for state management

## Code Style
- Keep code simple and straightforward
- Avoid over-engineering solutions
- This is for demo/experimental purposes
